            Top 3 Ways to Consume Fun Memes
        </h2>
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cultofbiscuit/">Instagram: Cult of Biscuit</a>
        <article>
            This is one of my favorite Instagram accounts, Cult of Biscuit. They frequently edit their calico cat into an alien and adds another layer of cuteness.

        <article>
            Another website besides Instagram that you can visit to check up on memes is a website called Know Your Meme. You can search for any popular meme in it's database and you can even learn how it originated.
            I searched for Larry, who is known to be "evil" and menacing.

        <article>
            You can even find incredibly viral animal memes on Youtube and other media sources. This video linked is simply called "Maw" but it has over 7 million views, and is even a reupload of the original,
            which had even more views than this one.
